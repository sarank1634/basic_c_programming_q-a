// Rickshaw Fare Calculation

// Write a C program to calculate the rickshaw fare based on the distance traveled.

// Fare rules:

// If the distance is less than or equal to 3 km, the fare is a fixed ₹5.

// If the distance is more than 3 km, the fare is:

// ₹5 + ₹2 for every kilometer after the 3rd km

// Example:
// If the distance is 7 km, then
// Fare = 5 + (7 − 3) × 2 = 5 + 8 = ₹13
